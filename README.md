# What is this?

Just a bunch of what I call C++ *artifacts*: tiny explorations of C++ to get my brain used to the procedural programming mindset again
(and to train myself to recognize memory leaks on the spot).

# List of artifacts
1. `small_string.cpp` is just the implementation of a `SmallString` class, which behaves more or less like strings, with a buffer in the stack so that there's no need for allocation for small strings.
